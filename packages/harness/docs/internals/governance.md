# Governance

Felix applies eight governance layers to every tool call: secret masking, policies, command screening, content screening, limits, guardrails, llm_judge, approvals. They compose at build time and run on every invocation. A federated `PolicyBundle` overlays manifest-declared policies and approvals.

## Composition

`buildAgent` step 10 ([src/manifests/builder.ts](../../src/manifests/builder.ts)):

```ts
const merged = mergeWithManifest(manifest.spec.policies, manifest.spec.approvals);

tools = applySecretMasking(tools, env, manifestId);   // innermost, always on
if (merged.policies.length)              tools = applyPolicies(tools,    merged.policies,   manifestId);
if (commandScreeningEnabled(screening))  tools = applyCommandScreening(tools, screening,    manifestId);
if (contentScreeningEnabled(content))    tools = applyContentScreening(tools, content,      manifestId);
if (anyLimit(manifest.spec.limits))      tools = applyLimits(tools,      manifest.spec.limits, manifestId);
if (guardrailsEnabled(guardrails))       tools = applyGuardrails(tools,  guardrails,        manifestId);
if (judgesEnabled(guardrails))           tools = applyJudges(tools,      guardrails,        manifestId);
if (merged.approvals.length)             tools = applyApprovals(tools,   merged.approvals,  manifestId);
```

Each wrapper rewrites the tools array, returning new `Tool` objects whose `executor` delegates to the inner one. The wrappers use `wrapExecutor(inner.executor, ...)` from [src/tools/executor.ts](../../src/tools/executor.ts), which preserves the inner `transport` label (`local` / `mcp` / `a2a` / `container` / `queue` / `sandbox` / `browser`) so audit and observability can still report the true transport after composition. The order of application determines the runtime stack:

```
model call -> tool dispatch
            -> Approvals     (gate)
            -> LLM Judge     (post-call score)
            -> Guardrails    (filter)
            -> Limits        (cap)
            -> Content screen (injection classifier, post-call)
            -> Command screen (shell-aware command rules)
            -> Policies      (scope-check)
            -> Secret masking (strip our own credentials from output)
            -> inner tool
```

Secret masking is the innermost layer and the only one that is **always on**. Being innermost means it is the first post-processing to run on the way out, so the injection classifier, the guardrail filter, judges, and the react loop's audit row all see output whose credentials are already gone — a secret still present when any of those run has already reached a model or a durable row. It is not opt-in because there is no manifest where echoing this Worker's own credentials into a context window is the intended behavior, and a flag would mean the manifests that forgot it are exactly the ones that leak. See [internals/auth.md](auth.md) and `src/security/secret-masking.ts`.

Read the two screening layers in the direction that matters for each: command screening acts on the way **in** (it inspects arguments and can refuse before the tool runs), content screening acts on the way **out** (it classifies the result). Content screening is applied inner precisely so that, on the return path, it sees the raw tool output before the guardrail filter, the judges, and the approvals wrapper — a judge is itself a model reading that text, so screening after it would just move the attack surface. See [spec.content_screening](../guide/manifest-reference.md#speccontent_screening).

Command screening sits directly above the scope check so a forbidden command is refused before it can spend a limits budget, a guardrail scan, or a judge's model call. It only wraps tools on command-executing transports (`sandbox` / `container`) unless `command_screening.tools` says otherwise — screening a `local` tool's string arguments would be pure false-positive surface. See [spec.command_screening](../guide/manifest-reference.md#speccommand_screening) for the rule model and the explicit statement of what it does *not* protect against.

Read top-to-bottom for the call direction; bottom-to-top for which layer was applied first at build time.

## Deny-output contract

Every wrapper returns its deny via `denyOutput(content, source)` from [src/tools/types.ts](../../src/tools/types.ts) — they never throw. The model sees the `content` string in the tool result and can adapt: retry with different args, try a different tool, or surface the limitation to the user. Throwing would abort the loop and lose context.

The marker (a module-private `Symbol` stamped on `metadata`, plus `metadata.source`) lets outer wrappers detect inner denies via `isWrapperDeny(output)`. The guardrails output filter uses this to short-circuit — without it, a policy/approval/limit deny string would get re-scanned and possibly redacted. The marker is deliberately **not** a public string key: a tool executor returns an arbitrary `{ content, metadata }` object, so a string flag would let a malicious/buggy tool forge a wrapper-deny — exempting its own output from guardrail/judge filtering and suppressing its `tool_call` audit row. Only `denyOutput` (wrapper code) can reference the symbol, so the marker is unforgeable by tools.

:::caution[New post-call wrappers must check `isWrapperDeny`]
When writing a new wrapper that does **post-call** work (output filtering, scoring, transformation), check `isWrapperDeny(out)` first and pass the deny through verbatim. Missing this check causes outer wrappers to double-process an inner deny as if it were a normal tool result.
:::

## Fatal tool errors

Tools may declare `fatal: true` when constructing via `defineTool({ ..., fatal: true })` or `defineToolWithExecutor({ ..., fatal: true })`. By default, an exception thrown from `tool.executor.execute(...)` is stringified as `[tool error] <msg>` and fed back to the model so it can recover. With `fatal: true`, the react loop terminates immediately with the tool error message as `final` — the model never sees the failure.

:::caution[Use `fatal: true` sparingly]
Reasonable cases:
- Hard quota exhaustion that won't recover within the run.
- Security violations the model should not be allowed to retry around.
- Configuration errors that mean the tool is unusable for the entire request.

Recoverable conditions (a flaky API call, a transient lookup miss, malformed args) should stay non-fatal so the model can adapt. Overusing `fatal: true` prevents the model from recovering from transient failures.
:::

## Cancellation via ctx.signal

:::tip[Always thread `ctx.signal` through outbound work]
Without `signal`, the wall-clock check only blocks the *next* tool call — a long-running fetch already in-flight runs to completion and holds an isolate slot. Pass the signal through to honour wall-clock caps correctly.
:::

The per-request `LimitState.abortController` fires when the wall-clock cap elapses or the request is torn down. Patterns inject `signal` into `ToolInvocationCtx`; the executor receives it and tool authors should pass it through to outbound work:

```ts
defineTool({
  name: 'fetch_thing',
  description: '...',
  args: z.object({ url: z.string() }),
  async handler({ url }, ctx) {
    const resp = await fetch(url, { signal: ctx?.signal });
    return await resp.text();
  },
});
```

Without `signal`, the wall-clock check only blocks the *next* tool call — a long-running fetch already in-flight runs to completion. With it, AbortError surfaces and the tool returns the catch-block output (e.g. `[cancelled] ...`). The built-in non-local executors — `A2AExecutor` ([src/a2a/client.ts](../../src/a2a/client.ts)), `McpExecutor` ([src/mcp/client.ts](../../src/mcp/client.ts)), and `ContainerExecutor` ([src/tools/container-executor.ts](../../src/tools/container-executor.ts)) — already plumb the signal through to their outbound fetches; custom tools and custom executors that fetch external services should match the pattern.

## Policies

Source: `src/policy/wrap.ts`, `src/policy/models.ts`.

A policy declares required scopes on a set of tools:

```yaml
policies:
  - id: write-paths
    description: Writes need explicit grant
    required_scopes: ["data:write"]
    tools: ["create_record", "update_record"]
```

When a wrapped tool is invoked, the wrapper reads `principal.scopes` from the AsyncLocalStorage context and AND-checks every applicable policy:

```
principalScopes = ctx.auth.principal.scopes (Set<string>)
missing = policy.required_scopes.filter(s => !principalScopes.has(s))
if missing.length: emit policy_decision audit (denied), return deny string
```

When a tool appears in multiple policies, **all** must pass.

**Tool targeting matches by glob, not just exact name** (`src/tools/tool-match.ts`, shared by policies, approvals, and judges). A `tools` / `target_tools` entry is either an exact name, a trailing-`*` prefix (`stripe__*`), or a bare `*` (all tools). This closes an MCP gap: MCP tools are named `${serverName}__${remoteToolName}` where the remote server chooses the suffix, so exact-name targeting let a malicious server dodge a policy/approval/judge by renaming its tools. The `serverName` prefix comes from the manifest's `mcp_servers[].name` (server-proof), so `stripe__*` gates the entire server regardless of what it names its tools.

Audit event:
```json
{ "event_type": "policy_decision", "status": "denied",
  "payload": { "policy_id": "...", "tool": "...", "missing_scopes": [...], "outcome": "denied" } }
```

Counter: `orchestrator_policy_decisions { outcome, policy_id, manifest_id }`.

## Limits

Source: `src/limits/wrap.ts`, `src/limits/models.ts`, `src/limits/state.ts`.

Manifest declares per-run caps:

```yaml
limits:
  max_tool_calls: 40            # ceiling: 200
  max_wall_clock_seconds: 120   # ceiling: 600
  max_peer_hops: 2              # ceiling: 5
  max_input_tokens: 100000      # ceiling: 1_000_000
  max_output_tokens: 8000       # ceiling: 100_000
```

Absolute ceilings (`ABSOLUTE_LIMITS` in [src/limits/models.ts](../../src/limits/models.ts)) apply even if the schema is bypassed — `applyLimits` and `checkTokenBudget` run every declared cap through `clampLimits` before enforcing, so a `Limits` object built without Zod (a test harness or future programmatic builder) can't exceed the ceiling. `null` caps stay `null` (no manifest-level cap):

| Cap | Ceiling |
|---|---|
| `max_tool_calls` | 200 |
| `max_wall_clock_seconds` | 600 |
| `max_peer_hops` | 5 |
| `max_input_tokens` | 1,000,000 |
| `max_output_tokens` | 100,000 |
| `recursion_limit` | 50 |
| `max_turns` | 20 |

`null` in the manifest means "no manifest-level cap"; the absolute ceiling still applies.

### State

`LimitState` lives on `RequestContext.limitState` (installed by auth middleware, torn down via `disposeLimitState` in `finally`):

```ts
{
  toolCalls: 0,
  peerHops: 0,
  startedAt: Date.now(),
  auditCount: 0,
  auditTruncatedEmitted: false,
  abortController: new AbortController(),  // fires on wall-clock breach or teardown
  wallClockTimerId?: setTimeout(...),       // armed on first wrapped call
  tokens: { input: 0, output: 0 },          // accumulated by patterns/model.ts:recordUsage
}
```

Tool wrappers read it through `currentLimitState()` ([src/limits/state.ts](../../src/limits/state.ts)). Because it's AsyncLocalStorage-bound, no parameter threading is needed and tool authors cannot tamper with it.

### Check order

Per invocation, before incrementing:

1. Wall clock: `(Date.now() - state.startedAt) / 1000 > max_wall_clock_seconds`
2. Tool calls: `state.toolCalls >= max_tool_calls`
3. Peer hops: `(inner.isPeer || inner.name.startsWith('peer_')) && state.peerHops >= max_peer_hops`

On any breach: return `denyOutput(...)` (content `[limit exceeded] <name> cap of <cap> reached at tool '<tool>'`), emit `limit_exceeded` audit event, do not increment.

On pass: increment `toolCalls` (always) and `peerHops` (peer tools only). Inject `state.abortController.signal` into `ctx.signal` so the tool sees cancellation if wall-clock fires mid-call.

Counter: `orchestrator_limit_breaches { limit, manifest_id }`.

### Token caps

Token caps live on the same `Limits` block but are **not** checked by the per-tool wrapper — tools don't accrue tokens, model calls do. Patterns run two checks immediately before each `model.chat` / `model.streamChat`:

1. `checkPreflightTokenBudget(model, messages, tools, limits, manifestId)` — gated by `limits.precount` and `max_input_tokens` and only effective when the route implements `countTokens`. Anthropic's free `/v1/messages/count_tokens` projects the next call's input; if `state.tokens.input + projected >= max_input_tokens`, the call is denied before any paid request is made. Count failures are swallowed (the post-call check picks up the slack).
2. `checkTokenBudget(limits, manifestId)` — compares the cumulative `state.tokens.input` / `state.tokens.output` against `max_input_tokens` / `max_output_tokens`.

Call sites in [src/limits/wrap.ts](../../src/limits/wrap.ts):

- `react.ts` / `deep.ts` — before every loop iteration's model call (both `invoke` and `streamEvents`).
- `router.ts` — before the classifier call (falls back to first sub-agent if budget blown).
- `parallel.ts` — before the aggregator call (returns the deny as the final message).

`recordUsage(result, { manifestId, modelId })` in [src/patterns/model.ts](../../src/patterns/model.ts) accumulates `result.usage` onto `state.tokens.input` / `state.tokens.output`. Cache reads and cache creations still occupy the request's input context window, so they count against `max_input_tokens` — `state.tokens.input += input + cache_creation + cache_read`. The OpenAI client subtracts `cached_tokens` from `prompt_tokens` before reporting `usage.input`, matching the Anthropic shape so cached tokens don't double-count. Per-kind counters (`orchestrator_tokens { manifest_id, model, kind ∈ input | output | cache_creation | cache_read }`) capture the cost split for observability. Sub-agents share the parent's `LimitState`, so token spend in a fan-out aggregates across everyone.

### Wall-clock abort timer

`armWallClockAbort(state, limits, manifestId)` ([src/limits/wrap.ts](../../src/limits/wrap.ts)) is idempotent — only the first wrapped call per request schedules the timer. When it fires, `state.abortController.abort(...)` cancels in-flight `fetch` calls that have `ctx.signal` plumbed through. Without the timer, a long-running tool past the budget would run to completion; only the *next* call would see the breach.

`disposeLimitState` in [src/context.ts](../../src/context.ts) is the cleanup hook — clears the timer, fires abort if it hasn't already. Auth middleware calls it in `finally`; cron + queue handlers do the same in [apps/api/src/index.ts](../../../../apps/api/src/index.ts).

### Audit truncation

`limitState.auditCount` tracks audit events per request; cap is 200. On hit, one `audit_truncated` event with `payload: { reason, cap }` is emitted (`auditTruncatedEmitted` flips), and further events are silently dropped. Defends against runaway loops bloating the queue.

## Guardrails

Source: `src/guardrails/wrap.ts`, `src/guardrails/pipeline.ts`, `src/guardrails/models.ts`.

```yaml
guardrails:
  providers: [pii]              # currently: "pii", "bedrock" (placeholder)
  block_on_match: false         # true -> deny; false -> redact and continue
  targets: [input, output]      # which side(s) of the call to filter
```

### PII redactor

Four regex patterns (`src/guardrails/pipeline.ts:21-38`):

| Name | Pattern |
|---|---|
| `email` | `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}` |
| `ssn` | `\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b` |
| `phone` | `\b(?:\+?1[-.\s]?)?\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b` |
| `credit_card` | `\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b` |

Hits are replaced with `[REDACTED:<name>]`. For each hit, an audit `Match` is recorded with a **fingerprint only** — SHA-256 of the matched text truncated to the first 8 hex bytes. The raw value never goes to audit.

### Bedrock placeholder

`bedrockFilter` returns the input unchanged. Reserved for a future AI Gateway content policy hook; including it in `providers: [bedrock]` is a no-op today.

## LLM Judge

Source: `src/guardrails/judge-wrap.ts`, `src/guardrails/models.ts`.

```yaml
guardrails:
  judges:
    - name: relevance
      threshold: 0.7                                   # default 0.7; pass floor
      model: '@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast'  # optional; this is the default
      criteria: |
        response should be on-topic and directly answer the tool input
      target_tools: ['fetch_page', 'page_links']       # optional; empty = all tools
```

Composed *after* guardrails (`applyJudges(tools, guardrails, manifestId)`) so judges score a result that has already been redacted/filtered. Each applicable judge calls `env.AI.run(rule.model, { messages: [...] })` once per matching tool call (native binding — no AI Gateway hop) with the tool name, args (sliced to 500 chars), output (sliced to 2000 chars), and the `criteria` string. The judge model is expected to return JSON `{"score": <float>, "reasoning": "<text>"}`.

Judges only run on a clean inner result — outputs already flagged via `isWrapperDeny` (a deny from policy/limits/guardrails/approvals) or carrying a tool-error code are passed through untouched. Applicable judges run in order; the **first** below-threshold judge short-circuits to a deny.

Per-judge behavior:

- Every score emits a `judge_score` audit event with `status: 'pass' | 'fail'` and `payload: { judge, tool, transport, score, threshold, reasoning }` (`reasoning` truncated to 500 chars). There is no `source` field on the payload.
- When `score < threshold` the wrapper returns `denyOutput('[judge denied] tool '<name>' failed judge '<judge>' (score <s> < <threshold>): <reasoning>', 'guardrails')` — the deny is sourced as `'guardrails'`, and the model sees the deny and adapts (the inner result is dropped). Below-threshold always denies; there is no score-only mode.

Failure handling: a missing `env.AI` binding returns `null` → the judge is **skipped** (treated as a pass) and `orchestrator_judge_skipped { reason, judge, manifest_id }` increments. A model-call error or an unparseable reply, however, yields `passed: false` with score 0, so the result is **denied** (a model error increments `orchestrator_judge_error { judge, manifest_id }`); only the absent-binding case fails open.

Counter: `orchestrator_judge_scores { judge, tool, verdict, manifest_id }` (`verdict ∈ pass | fail`).

The `reflect` pattern also emits `judge_score` audit events, but tags them with `payload.source: 'reflect'` (`src/patterns/reflect.ts`) so an operator can distinguish a reflect verifier score from a guardrails-judge score — the guardrails judge omits `source` entirely.

### Wrap behavior

For each invocation:

```
if targets.includes('input'):
  for each string arg: run all providers
  if matches:
    audit guardrail_block { surface: 'input', matches }
    if block_on_match: return deny string
    else: replace arg with filtered

invoke inner tool
if out is string and targets.includes('output'):
  run all providers on out
  if matches:
    audit guardrail_block { surface: 'output', matches }
    if block_on_match: return deny string
    else: replace string with filtered
```

Counter: `orchestrator_guardrail_blocks { surface, manifest_id }`.

### Final-response guard

The wrapper above only sees **tool traffic**. The model's final user-facing answer isn't a tool call, so it's filtered by a separate hook — `guardFinalResponse` ([src/guardrails/final-response.ts](../../src/guardrails/final-response.ts)) — invoked by the react / deep / reflect / plan_execute loops at the terminal message, **outside** the executor wrapper chain (it operates on the assistant `ChatMessage.content`). It runs only when `guardrails.targets` includes `final_response` and there is at least one provider.

```
at the loop's terminal assistant turn:
  if targets.includes('final_response') and providers:
    run all providers on message.content
    if matches:
      audit guardrail_block { surface: 'final_response', matches }   # fingerprints only
      on_match == 'block' ? replace whole answer with a notice : replace content with filtered
```

Streaming has three modes. `buffer` holds deltas back, filters the completed answer, and emits the guarded text as one chunk (correct, costs TTFT). `incremental` streams filtered deltas live, holding back a bounded tail (`SAFE_TAIL_CHARS`, ~320) so a match spanning a chunk boundary is caught before its bytes are emitted — a single contiguous secret longer than the window could leak its prefix. `passthrough` streams deltas raw and only guards the persisted terminal message, emitting `orchestrator_final_guard_skipped { reason: 'streaming_passthrough' }`. Content-filter redaction works under all three, but `on_match: 'block'` cannot be combined with `incremental` — the filtered deltas have already streamed, so validation rejects the pair rather than silently downgrading block to redact (`passthrough` still blocks the persisted/returned copy). A `final_response` judge can only BLOCK under `buffer` / non-streaming (the others have already sent bytes — incremental emits `orchestrator_final_guard_skipped { reason: 'streaming_incremental_judge' }` when a judge retroactively blocks). Only `content` is touched — `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks are preserved.

Multi-agent coverage: **parallel** guards the aggregator's synthesized answer. **groupchat** filters every speaker turn — the whole transcript is returned to the caller and persisted to the session log, so intermediate turns are not internal — and runs the full final-response guard on the last turn, before persisting (guard-then-persist, matching react). Both use the parent manifest's guardrails. **router** is a pass-through — it forwards the chosen sub-agent's response verbatim (post-filtering a forwarded stream would mean buffering the whole child stream), so final-response guarding for a router is delegated to the sub-agent manifests, which run their own guard.

A judge flagged `final_response: true` scores the answer here too, after the content filter — a below-threshold score blocks (replaces the answer with the notice) and emits `judge_score { source: 'final_response' }`. Judges need the full answer, so they block only on the non-streaming path and streaming `buffer` mode; under `passthrough` the bytes have already streamed. The tool-side `applyJudges` skips `final_response` judges. In groupchat, judges run once — on the final turn; intermediate speaker turns get the content filters only.

A `fatal: true` tool error is also a terminal answer — the react loop runs the same guard over the fatal message before it's returned, streamed (`on_tool_end` included), or persisted, since upstream error bodies can carry secrets. Intermediate (non-terminal) assistant text in `buffer` mode is still flushed unguarded — only the terminal answer is covered.

## Approvals

Source: `src/approvals/wrap.ts`, `src/approvals/store.ts`, `src/approvals/approvals-do.ts`, `src/approvals/models.ts`.

```yaml
approvals:
  - id: production-writes
    description: All writes require approval
    tools: ["create_record", "update_record"]
```

### Unattended runs are refused first

Before any of the steps below, the wrapper checks whether a human is present. A cron tick, a continuous-eval replay, a detached eval run, or a plugin scheduled task installs a `RequestContext` flagged `unattended` (`buildBackgroundContext` in [src/context.ts](../../src/context.ts)); on such a run an approval-gated tool is denied **before the store is consulted**, so a live grant is neither read nor consumed.

The rationale: approving a call is a point-in-time human judgment about the call in front of the operator, not a standing authorization for a background job to replay the same signature indefinitely. Because the default signature is tenant-wide and non-expiring, the pre-existing behavior was for a scheduled run to silently inherit whatever a person had approved earlier in a chat.

Opt a specific rule out with `allow_unattended: true` — the run then rejoins the normal flow, still needing a real grant, and pairs well with `ttl_seconds` / `one_shot` to bound the standing authorization. Refusals emit `approval_decision` with `reason: 'unattended_run'` and the `orchestrator_approval_decisions{outcome=denied_unattended}` counter.

### First invocation

1. Parse args through the tool's Zod schema (rejects unknown keys, normalizes order).
2. Compute deterministic call signature:
   ```
   callSignature = SHA-256(`${manifestId}|${toolName}|${canonicalize(args)}`)
   ```
   `canonicalize` sorts keys before stringifying so semantically-equivalent args hash the same.
3. `findBySignature(env, tenantId, manifestId, toolName, callSignature)` — Postgres lookup using the unique index `uq_approval_signature`.
4. On miss: `INSERT` an `approvals` row with `status='pending'`, `args_json = redactSecrets(args)`. Emit `approval_request` audit (`status: pending`). Return deny string to the model:
   ```
   [approval required] tool '<name>' requires human approval. approval_id=<uuid>. Retry later with the same arguments.
   ```

### Decision

`POST /approvals/:id/decide` routes through `ApprovalsDO` (`src/api/approvals.ts`):

1. Pre-check tenant ownership in Postgres (return 404 if not owned; avoid locking the DO on a probe).
2. `approvalsDoStub(env, tenantId, id).fetch('https://do/decide', { ... })` — the DO uses `blockConcurrencyWhile` so concurrent decisions serialize.
3. The DO calls back into `decideRequest()` which updates the Postgres row.
4. Emit `approval_decision` audit (`status: approved` or `status: denied`).

The DO is a critical section, not the system of record. Postgres is the source of truth.

### Retry

When the model retries with the same args:

- Signature hashes to the same value.
- Lookup returns the existing row.
- If `status='approved'`: emit `approval_decision` (approved), use `edited_args_json` if set otherwise original `args`, call through to the inner tool.
- If `status='denied'`: emit `approval_decision` (denied), return deny string with `decision_note`.
- If `status='pending'`: same deny string as first invocation. The unique index guarantees no duplicate row is inserted.

Counters:
- `orchestrator_approval_requests { manifest_id }`
- `orchestrator_approval_decisions { outcome, manifest_id }`

## Federation

Source: `src/policy/bundle.ts`, `src/policy/federation-do.ts`.

A central authority ships a signed `PolicyBundle` to R2:

```json
{
  "version": "2026.05.13-01",
  "issuer": "felix-federation",
  "policies": [{ "id": "...", "required_scopes": [...], "tools": [...] }],
  "approvals": [...],
  "signature": "<base64 Ed25519>"
}
```

### Lifecycle

1. **Authoring** — author bundle JSON, sign deterministically (key-sorted JSON with `signature` removed) with the Ed25519 private key whose public key is in `POLICY_BUNDLE_PUBKEY`.
2. **Upload** — `wrangler r2 object put` to the bucket at `POLICY_BUNDLE_KEY`.
3. **Refresh** — every 10 minutes the worker cron fires `federationStub(env).fetch('https://do/refresh')`. The `FederationDO` pulls from R2, verifies the signature, and updates its cached bundle and `refreshedAt`.
4. **Verification** — `crypto.subtle.verify({ name: 'Ed25519' }, key, sig, target)` against the JSON-with-signature-removed key-sorted form.
   - Staging/production: signature mismatch keeps the previous active bundle in place; an unsigned bundle is rejected.
   - Development: signature failures log a warning and load anyway.
5. **Process-local cache** — `syncFederationCache(env)` populates an in-isolate variable read by `getActiveBundle()` on the hot path so the DO isn't hit per request.

### Merge semantics

`mergeWithManifest(manifest.policies, manifest.approvals)` (`src/policy/bundle.ts`):

- Manifest's policies and approvals are loaded first into a `Map` by id.
- Bundle policies are loaded second; **bundle wins on id collision** — a central revocation cannot be silently disabled by a manifest authoring a policy with the same id.
- Bundle-side approvals are typed as full `ApprovalRule`s (`PolicyBundleSchema.approvals: ApprovalRule[]`) and are **cross-merged the same way** — loaded second into the id `Map` so **bundle wins on id collision**. A bundle-contributed approval rule gates the matching tool through `applyApprovals` exactly like a manifest rule, so a central authority can distribute approval gates fleet-wide and a manifest cannot silently disable one.

## Wrapping summary

| Layer | Reads | Decision | On fail | Audit | Counter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Policies | `principal.scopes` | scope AND-check | deny string | `policy_decision` | `policy_decisions` |
| Limits | `LimitState` | wall_clock / tool_calls / peer_hops / tokens | deny string | `limit_exceeded` | `limit_breaches` |
| Guardrails | filter providers | regex hits / placeholder | deny or redact | `guardrail_block` | `guardrail_blocks` |
| LLM Judge | `env.AI` criteria score | score < threshold | deny string | `judge_score` | `judge_scores` |
| Approvals | Postgres status + call signature | pending/approved/denied | deny string | `approval_request`, `approval_decision` | `approval_*` |

Every wrapper's audit row and counter row carry the inner tool's `transport` (`local` / `mcp` / `a2a` / `container` / `queue` / `sandbox` / `browser`) as a payload field / label, so an operator can slice "policy denies by transport" or "approval requests for `container` tools." The transport label survives wrapping because each wrapper uses `wrapExecutor(inner.executor, ...)` (see [src/tools/executor.ts](../../src/tools/executor.ts)), which preserves the inner `transport` on the new outer executor — so `inner.executor.transport` is always available at audit/counter time.
